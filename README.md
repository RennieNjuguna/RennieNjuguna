- Frontend: I use React with TypeScript for our web application's user interface, delivering a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- Backend: Node.js and Python Django power my server-side development, providing versatility and robust functionality. I also use Express.js for building RESTful APIs and web services and Database integration with MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Databases: My data storage mainly includes MongoDB for meeting diverse data needs and MySQL for structured, relational data upon a client's request.
- Version Control: Git ensures efficient collaboration, change tracking, and codebase organization.
